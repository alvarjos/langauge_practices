# LOOPS
'''
Loops form the basis for tons of basic code. 

Two types:

    - while: you provide a conditional statement. The loop repeats until the statement is false

    - for: you provide an "iteratable" variable (like a range, a list, dictionary, etc.) and it
           loops for however many elements are in that variable.
           Note that this is different than most other programming languages.

# Practice:
# Do the same thing as the last practice, but instead, ask at first:
# "How many students do you want to enter? "
# then enter a name and gpa and print it out, but don't repeatedly ask if they want to enter another student
# just automatically end it once the number they initially entered is reached.

# Hint: this means you need to keep track of how many times the loop has run. How could you do that?
