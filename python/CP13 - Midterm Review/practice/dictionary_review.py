# given this Person class and 3 person objects:

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def print_info(self):
        print(f"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}")

person1 = Person("Alice", 30)
person2 = Person("Bob", 25)
person3 = Person("Charlie", 35)

# 1: Create a dictionary to store the person objects.
#       Use the persons name as the key, and the entire object as the value


# 2: Using the dictionary, individually access each of the objects and run their print_info method


# 3: Make another person and add them to the dictionary


# 4: Loop through the dictionary of people and run the print_info method for each
