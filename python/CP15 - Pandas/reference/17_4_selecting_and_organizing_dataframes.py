# Multiple conditions!!
###
# Note that in the file called "filtering_data" we'll go over a slightly easier way to do this,
# but that way has some limitations.

'''
To add multiple logical conditions, you need to:
    1. put each condition in parentheses
    2. Use panda's version of operators:
        - and: &
        - or: |
        - not: ~

    e.g. df.loc[(df["Column"] == "X") & (df["Column2"] < 10)]
'''
# try to find the rows where the age is over 22, or the type of dance is Tango
print()
print(dfDance.loc[(dfDance["Age"] > 22) | (dfDance["Type"] == "Tango")])

# do the same thing, but only show the Dancer name
print()
print(dfDance.loc[(dfDance["Age"] > 22) | (dfDance["Type"] == "Tango"), "Dancer"])

########
# Updating entire columns
########

# try to add 10 years to everyone's age:
dfDance["Age"] += 10
print(dfDance, "\n")

# try to subtrack 7 years to only those over 30
dfDance.loc[dfDance["Age"] > 30 , "Age"] -= 7
print(dfDance, "\n")

'''
Note that what you can do here is one of the main advantages
of using pandas over other data types / importing Excel files
with openpyxl. You can make changes to entire columns / subsections
without looping over things. It is very computationally efficient.
Plus, it is fewer lines of code.

# Getting just the values of a dataframe
########

# if you just want the data in a format to directly use (like strings)
# you can use .values. It returns everything in a list, with each row after that in a list.
