To write an API call in JavaScript that grabs all queries from an index in an OpenSearch database, you can use the OpenSearch or Elasticsearch JavaScript client, which provides methods for searching and scrolling through large datasets.

Explanation
Scroll API: This API is useful for fetching large datasets from an OpenSearch or Elasticsearch index in chunks. It works by "scrolling" through the data instead of returning everything in one go.
Client.helpers.scrollSearch(): This is a method that simplifies working with the scroll API in Elasticsearch (or OpenSearch) and allows you to paginate through results.
The following example demonstrates how to get all queries from an index using a similar approach to the function you provided.

API Call to Get All Queries from an OpenSearch Index
Here’s a similar approach using the OpenSearch JavaScript client:

javascript
```js
const { Client } = require('@opensearch-project/opensearch'); // or 'elasticsearch' for Elasticsearch

const client = new Client({
  node: 'https://your-opensearch-endpoint.com', // OpenSearch cluster endpoint
  auth: {
    username: 'your-username',
    password: 'your-password'
  }
});

// Function to retrieve all documents (queries) from a given index
const getAllQueriesItr = (client) => {
  return async function* (indexName, size = 100) {
    // Define the scroll search
    const scrollSearch = client.helpers.scrollSearch({
      index: indexName,
      body: {
        size,
        query: {
          match_all: {} // Get all documents
        }
      }
    });

    // Iterate over each result set (scroll through the index)
    for await (const result of scrollSearch) {
      yield result.documents.map(d => d.query); // Assuming each document has a 'query' field
    }
  }
}

// Example usage
(async () => {
  try {
    const queryIterator = getAllQueriesItr(client);
    for await (const queries of queryIterator('your-index-name')) {
      console.log('Queries:', queries);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching queries:', error);
  }
})();

```
Key Components
Client: Connects to the OpenSearch (or Elasticsearch) cluster. Make sure to provide the correct OpenSearch cluster node URL and authentication details.

getAllQueriesItr:

This is an asynchronous generator function (async function*) that allows you to lazily fetch chunks of data using the scrollSearch helper function.
The function accepts an index name and an optional size parameter, which controls the number of documents fetched per batch (default is 100).
scrollSearch:

Used to paginate through the documents in the index.
Inside the loop, we extract the query field from each document (assuming each document in your index has a query field that holds the SQL queries or whatever query structure you're storing).
Customizations
Index Name: Replace 'your-index-name' with the actual name of your OpenSearch index that contains the queries.
Auth: Adjust the client’s authentication method as per your OpenSearch cluster setup. If using AWS-managed OpenSearch, you might need to use AWS-specific auth.
Example Index and Document Structure
If your documents in OpenSearch look something like this:

json
```json
{
  "_index": "queries",
  "_type": "_doc",
  "_id": "1",
  "_source": {
    "query": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18",
    "createdAt": "2024-09-27T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```
The getAllQueriesItr function will yield each query from the documents in the query field.

Error Handling
You can customize error handling in case there’s an issue with the API call (e.g., connection problems, permission issues, etc.) by catching the error inside the try-catch block.

Notes
Scroll Duration: By default, the scrollSearch method in the OpenSearch client automatically handles scrolls internally. You don’t need to specify the scroll duration manually. However, if you need to, you can set it by adding a scroll parameter (e.g., scroll: '1m' for a 1-minute scroll timeout).

Performance Considerations: Set the size appropriately depending on how much memory and performance your environment can handle.

This approach allows you to fetch large sets of queries from an OpenSearch index without loading all the documents into memory at once, which is useful for handling big data efficiently.




in the first example, how does the map(d => d.query) work?
```js
const getAllQueriesItr = (client) => {
  return async function* (indexName, size = 100) {
    // Define the scroll search
    const scrollSearch = client.helpers.scrollSearch({
      index: indexName,
      body: {
        size,
        query: {
          match_all: {} // Get all documents
        }
      }
    });

    // Iterate over each result set (scroll through the index)
    for await (const result of scrollSearch) {
      yield result.documents.map(d => d.query); // Assuming each document has a 'query' field
    }
  }
}
```
In the line yield result.documents.map(d => d.query), the .map(d => d.query) is a common JavaScript array method used to transform the array of documents returned by OpenSearch/Elasticsearch. Let’s break it down step by step.

Breakdown
result.documents:

This is an array of documents that the OpenSearch client returns after a scroll search query.
Each element in this array represents one document in the index.
Example of a single document returned in the result.documents array:

```json
{
  "_index": "queries",
  "_id": "1",
  "_source": {
    "query": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18",
    "createdAt": "2024-09-27T12:00:00Z"
  }
}

// Here, result.documents might look like:

[
  { "_id": "1", "_source": { "query": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18" } },
  { "_id": "2", "_source": { "query": "SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = 123" } }
]
```
.map(d => d.query):


.map() is an array method that takes a function and applies it to every element of the array, transforming each element and returning a new array with the transformed values.
d => d.query is an arrow function that takes each document (d) from result.documents and returns the value of its query field.
So, .map(d => d.query) will:

Go through each document in result.documents.
For each document (d), it will extract the query field (assuming it exists).
If the original result.documents array contains documents like:

```json
[
  { "_id": "1", "_source": { "query": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18" } },
  { "_id": "2", "_source": { "query": "SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = 123" } }
]

// The .map(d => d.query) will transform this into:


[
  "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18",
  "SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = 123"
]
```
Yielding the Results
The yield keyword is part of the generator function. When using yield, the function pauses execution and returns the current result to the caller but retains its state to continue from where it left off.

So, in this case, yield result.documents.map(d => d.query) will return an array of queries (strings) each time the for await loop gets a batch of documents from OpenSearch.

Example with Data
Assume you have this data in the index:

```json
{
  "documents": [
    { "_id": "1", "_source": { "query": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18" } },
    { "_id": "2", "_source": { "query": "SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = 123" } }
  ]
}

// For a batch of documents returned by the scroll search, result.documents.map(d => d.query) will transform this to:

[
  "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18",
  "SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = 123"
]
```
Assumption: Field Existence
The code assumes that each document has a query field. If some documents do not have this field, you could add error handling or checks, like this:

```js
result.documents.map(d => d.query || null) // To handle cases where 'query' might not exist
```

Adjusting for Actual Document Structure
In OpenSearch/Elasticsearch, document data is typically stored under the _source key. If this is the case in your index, you would need to adjust the .map() to access the query field inside _source:

```js
result.documents.map(d => d._source.query)
```
This ensures you’re correctly accessing the query field from the document’s source data.

```js
for await (const result of scrollSearch) {
  yield result.documents.map(d => d._source.query); // Access 'query' inside '_source'
}
```

This approach will map each document's query field and return it in the yielded array for each scroll result batch.


Your setup looks solid overall. You're leveraging Express, OpenSearch, and asynchronous generator functions in a typical Node.js application. However, there are a couple of improvements and fixes that can help smooth the execution of your code.

Issues and Suggestions
Controller: The controller should call the dataSource correctly and handle the async iteration.
Data Source: Your data source method correctly yields the documents, but ensure the client.helpers.scrollSearch is correctly initialized and handled.
Handler: You're using the asyncHandler pattern, but make sure getAllQueryResponses is designed to correctly accumulate data.
Here’s a revised approach:

1. Data Source: getAllQueryResponses
It looks like you're implementing a scroll search in OpenSearch (or Elasticsearch), which is efficient for large datasets. The async generator for await pattern is perfect here. Here’s the code with a minor adjustment:

```javascript
const getAllQueryResponses = (client) => {
  return async function* (size = 100) {
    const scrollSearch = client.helpers.scrollSearch({
      index: QUERY_INDEX_BASE_NAME,
      body: { size }
    });

    for await (const result of scrollSearch) {
      // Ensure result.documents exists and map over it
      if (result.documents) {
        yield result.documents.map(d => d.query);
      }
    }
  };
};
```
2. Controller: getAllQueryResponses Handler
The main adjustment is in how you iterate over the async generator. You’ll need to gather all the results from the generator and store them in req.responseData.

```javascript
const getAllQueryResponses = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const queryResponses = [];
    const scrollQueryResponses = req.dataSources.content.getAllQueryResponses(req.client); // Assuming req.client is your OpenSearch client

    for await (const queries of scrollQueryResponses()) {
      queryResponses.push(...queries); // Append all results into a single array
    }

    req.responseData = {
      ...req.responseData,
      queries: queryResponses // Store the queries in responseData
    };

    next();
  } catch (error) {
    next(error); // Forward error to error-handling middleware
  }
};
```
3. Express Router
Your router definition looks good overall, but make sure asyncHandler correctly handles async functions and passes errors to the middleware.

```javascript
const router = express.Router();

/**
* @swagger
* /search/v1/admin/query/all-query-responses:
*  get:
*    summary: Get ALL previous queries
*    description: >-
*      Retrieves all of the previous queries from the OpenSearch index
*    responses:
*      '200':
*        content:
*          application/json:
*            schema:
*              $ref: '#/components/schemas/GetAllQueryResponses'
*/
router.get(
  '/all-query-responses',
  asyncHandler(getAllQueryResponses), // Controller
  asyncHandler(filter(GetAllQueryResponses, 'responseData')), // Filter middleware
  (req, res) => res.json(req.responseData) // Send the final JSON response
);

module.exports = router;
```

Key Changes:
The getAllQueryResponses handler now gathers all results from the async generator into a single array.
The data source (getAllQueryResponses) correctly maps the documents and yields them.
The router remains the same but ensures the controller and filter middleware work asynchronously.
This structure should handle your use case of retrieving all previous queries efficiently, using scroll search to paginate large datasets from OpenSearch.

<br>

## Part 1 DataSources


This JavaScript code defines a function `getAllQueryResponses`, which is used to retrieve and process large sets of data from a database or search engine (probably Elasticsearch, based on the `scrollSearch` method).

Let’s break it down step by step:

### 1. `const getAllQueryResponses = (client) => {...}`
This is an arrow function that takes one argument, `client`. The `client` likely represents a connection to a service or database (for example, an Elasticsearch client).

### 2. `return async function * (size = 100) {...}`
- **`async function *`**: This declares an **asynchronous generator function**. An async generator allows you to yield values (pause and return values one by one) over time, while performing asynchronous operations (like fetching data).
- **`size = 100`**: This means the function accepts an optional argument `size`, with a default value of 100. This likely controls how many documents are fetched in one go.

### 3. `const scrollSearch = client.helpers.scrollSearch({...})`
Here, it’s calling the `scrollSearch` method, likely a helper function for performing "scrolling" searches (used to fetch large datasets in chunks). The `scrollSearch` method is passed a configuration:
- **`index: QUERY_INDEX_BASE_NAME`**: This specifies the index (or table) to search in.
- **`body: { size }`**: This sets the size (number of results) to retrieve per scroll, using the value of the `size` argument.

### 4. `for await (const result of scrollSearch) {...}`
This loops over the results of the scroll search. The `for await` loop is used because `scrollSearch` is an asynchronous process, meaning it takes time to complete each step. 

### 5. `yield result.documents.map(d => d.query)`
For each result returned by `scrollSearch`, the code does the following:
- **`result.documents.map(d => d.query)`**: It ensures that `result.documents` exists and applies the `map()` method to each document (`d`), extracting the `query` field from each document.
- **`yield`**: It then yields (returns) these extracted queries one by one from the generator.

### Summary:
This function is designed to:
1. Connect to a client (likely Elasticsearch).
2. Perform a large, scrolling search on a database index.
3. Extract the `query` field from each document in the result set.
4. Yield these query results one by one, asynchronously, allowing for processing of large datasets without loading everything into memory at once.

## Part 2 Controllers

This code defines an asynchronous function `getAllQueryResponses`, which processes query responses and stores them in the `req.responseData` object. It’s probably being used as middleware in a server (like in Express.js).

Let’s break it down step by step:

### 1. `const getAllQueryResponses = async (req, res, next) => {...}`
- This is an **asynchronous arrow function** that takes three parameters:
  - **`req`**: The request object, which holds data from the incoming request.
  - **`res`**: The response object, which will be used to send data back to the client.
  - **`next`**: This is a function that passes control to the next middleware function in the stack.

### 2. `const queryResponses = [];`
- This creates an empty array called `queryResponses`. It will hold the results fetched from the database or data source.

### 3. `const scrollQueryResponses = await req.dataSources.content.getAllQueryResponses();`
- **`await req.dataSources.content.getAllQueryResponses()`**: This calls the `getAllQueryResponses()` function (probably from your previous example) and waits for it to finish. This function likely retrieves the query responses in batches using a scrolling search.
- **`scrollQueryResponses`**: Stores the result of the scrolling query responses.

### 4. `for await (const queries of scrollQueryResponses) {...}`
- This is an asynchronous loop that iterates over each batch of `queries` returned by `scrollQueryResponses`. Each batch contains a set of query results.

### 5. `queryResponses.push(...queries)`
- **`push(...queries)`**: This spreads out (`...`) each batch of `queries` and appends them to the `queryResponses` array. It collects all query results into this single array.

### 6. `req.responseData = {...req.responseData, ...queryResponses}`
- This line updates the `responseData` property of the request object (`req`):
  - **`{...req.responseData}`**: This takes the existing `responseData` (if any).
  - **`...queryResponses`**: This adds all the query responses collected in the previous steps.
  - So, `req.responseData` now contains both the old data and the newly fetched queries.

### 7. `next()`
- This calls the `next()` function to pass control to the next middleware in the chain.

### Summary:
This function:
1. Fetches query responses from a data source using an asynchronous method.
2. Collects the query results into an array.
3. Merges those results into the request's `responseData` object.
4. Passes control to the next middleware function.

It is commonly used in web servers to handle requests, process data, and pass it along for further handling.


## Part 3 Routes
This code defines a route in an Express.js application that handles a **GET** request to fetch all previous queries. It uses Swagger documentation to describe the API, and middleware functions to process and filter the data before sending it back to the client.

Here’s the breakdown:

### 1. Swagger Documentation Block (`/** ... */`)
This block is for **Swagger**, a tool used for generating API documentation. It provides details about the `/search/v1/admin/query/all-query-responses` endpoint.

- **`/search/v1/admin/query/all-query-responses`**: The path for the GET request.
- **`summary`**: A brief description of what this endpoint does. It says that this endpoint retrieves all previous queries.
- **`description`**: A longer description, explaining that it pulls data from an OpenSearch index (a search engine similar to Elasticsearch).
- **`responses`**: Lists possible HTTP responses. 
  - `'200'` means that on success, the response will include data in JSON format.
  - **`$ref: '#/components/schemas/GetAllQueryResponses'`** refers to a predefined schema for the response data in the Swagger specification.

### 2. `router.get('/all-query-responses', ... )`
This is an Express route handler for the `GET` request to the `/all-query-responses` endpoint.

### 3. `asyncHandler(getAllQueryResponses)`
This calls the `getAllQueryResponses` function (the one you looked at earlier) using `asyncHandler`. `asyncHandler` is likely a utility function that wraps an asynchronous function and automatically handles errors by passing them to the next middleware.

### 4. `asyncHandler(filter(GetAllQueryResponses, 'responseData'))`
- **`filter(GetAllQueryResponses, 'responseData')`**: This looks like middleware that applies a filter on the data returned by `getAllQueryResponses`.
  - It probably takes the `GetAllQueryResponses` result and filters it by the `'responseData'` property of the request object (`req.responseData`).
- **`asyncHandler`** wraps this function as well, ensuring that any errors are handled properly.

### 5. `(req, res) => res.json(req.responseData)`
Finally, this is the last middleware in the chain, which sends the processed data back to the client as a JSON response.

- **`res.json(req.responseData)`**: Sends the `responseData` stored in the `req` object as a JSON response.

### Summary:
1. **Swagger** documents the API, explaining that it retrieves all previous queries from an OpenSearch index.
2. The route is defined at `/all-query-responses`.
3. The **`getAllQueryResponses`** function is executed to fetch the queries.
4. The **`filter`** middleware filters the response data based on the `'responseData'` property.
5. The filtered response is sent back to the client as JSON.

This setup ensures the request is handled, processed, filtered, and responded to, all in a clean, middleware-based flow.

// router.post('/set-new-query',
)

# POST Request 
To structure your `POST` API to save a `queryId` similar to the example, including Swagger documentation, controllers, schemas, and routes, here’s how you can set it up.

### Step 1: Define Your Swagger Documentation

In your `query.routes.js` file (for example), you can set up Swagger documentation for the `POST` request:

```javascript
/**
 * @swagger
 * /search/v1/admin/query/{queryId}:
 *  post:
 *    summary: Save Query
 *    description: >-
 *      Saves a query item into the query and current query indexes.
 *    parameters:
 *      - in: path
 *        name: queryId
 *        description: The ID of the query item to save
 *        required: true
 *        schema:
 *          $ref: '#/components/schemas/QueryId'
 *    requestBody:
 *      description: Query item to save to search engine
 *      required: true
 *      content:
 *        application/json:
 *          schema:
 *            $ref: '#/components/schemas/SaveQueryBody'
 *    responses:
 *      '200':
 *        description: The query item was saved
 *        content:
 *          application/json:
 *            schema:
 *              $ref: '#/components/schemas/SaveQueryResponse'
 *      '201':
 *        description: The query item was created and saved
 *        content:
 *          application/json:
 *            schema:
 *              $ref: '#/components/schemas/SaveQueryResponse'
 */
```

### Step 2: Create Controller and Schema

#### Controller (`query.controller.js`)

Here’s a `saveQuery` function for the controller:

```javascript
const { client } = require('../config/opensearch'); // OpenSearch client setup

const saveQuery = async (req, res, next) => {
  const { queryId } = req.params;

  try {
    // Save to query index
    await client.index({
      index: 'query_index', // Replace with actual query index name
      document: { queryId, timestamp: new Date() }
    });

    // Save to current query index
    await client.index({
      index: 'current_query_index', // Replace with actual current query index name
      document: { queryId, active: true, timestamp: new Date() }
    });

    req.responseData = { status: 'success', message: 'Query ID saved successfully' };
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error saving query ID:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ status: 'error', message: 'Failed to save query ID' });
  }
};

module.exports = { saveQuery };
```

#### Schema (`query.schema.js`)

Define the schema for the parameters and request body validation.

```javascript
const Joi = require('joi');

// Schema for path parameter validation
const SaveQueryParams = Joi.object({
  queryId: Joi.string().required() // Ensure queryId is provided as a string
});

// Schema for request body validation
const SaveQueryBody = Joi.object({
  additionalField: Joi.string().optional() // Example of additional fields to include
});

const SaveQueryResponse = Joi.object({
  status: Joi.string(),
  message: Joi.string()
});

module.exports = { SaveQueryParams, SaveQueryBody, SaveQueryResponse };
```

### Step 3: Set Up the Route (`query.routes.js`)

Create the route and integrate validation middleware and controllers.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const { saveQuery } = require('../controllers/query.controller');
const { SaveQueryParams, SaveQueryBody, SaveQueryResponse } = require('../schemas/query.schema');
const asyncHandler = require('express-async-handler');
const validate = require('../middleware/validate'); // Validation middleware
const filter = require('../middleware/filter'); // Response filter middleware

router.post('/:queryId',
  asyncHandler(validate(SaveQueryParams, 'params')),
  asyncHandler(validate(SaveQueryBody, 'body')),
  asyncHandler(saveQuery),
  asyncHandler(filter(SaveQueryResponse, 'responseData')),
  (req, res) => res.json(req.responseData)
);

module.exports = router;
```

### Explanation

1. **Swagger Documentation**: Defines the API endpoint `/search/v1/admin/query/{queryId}`.
2. **Controller (`saveQuery`)**: Manages the saving of the `queryId` to both the query and current query indexes.
3. **Schemas**: `SaveQueryParams` validates the `queryId` path parameter, while `SaveQueryBody` is for additional request body fields if needed.
4. **Route**: Applies validation and controller middleware, along with the response filtering middleware.

This setup should align closely with the structure you’re aiming for. Let me know if you need more details on any step!




## Template Controllers POST API Call
// Try grabbing from content.datasources function to grab the Id of the query, or the 
// body with queryTemplateBody

//   try {
//     // Save to query index
//     await client.index({
//       index: "query",
//       document: { queryId }
//     })

//     await client.index({
//       index: "current-active",
//       document: { queryId, active: true }
//     })

//     req.responseData = {status: 'success', message: "Query Id saved successfully" }
//     next()
//   } catch (error) {
//     console.error("Error saving query ID:", error)
//     res.status(500).json({ status: "error", message: "Failed to save query Id" })
//   }
// }

The `saveSearchContent` function is an Express middleware that saves a content item to a data source and returns a status code based on the operation's outcome. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. **Destructure Request Properties**: The function extracts `params`, `body` (renamed as `content`), and `dataSources` from the `req` object:
   - `params`: Contains URL parameters, including `contentId`.
   - `body`: Contains the request body, which includes the content data to save.
   - `dataSources`: Contains the `content` data source, where the `saveContent` method is called.

2. **ID Validation**: 
   - It checks if the `contentId` URL parameter matches the `id` field within the request body (`content.id`).
   - If they don’t match, the function stops further execution by passing a `BadRequestError` to `next()`, which should send a "400 Bad Request" response.

3. **Save Content**:
   - If the IDs match, it calls `dataSources.content.saveContent(req.body)` to save the content item.
   - This returns a `responseBody` containing a `result` field that indicates the outcome (`updated` or `created`).

4. **Set HTTP Status Code**:
   - The function maps `result` to a status code:
     - `updated` → `200 OK`
     - `created` → `201 Created`
   - `res.status(status[result])` sets the response status based on the outcome.

5. **Pass Control to Next Middleware**:
   - Finally, `next()` is called to proceed to the next middleware, which is likely to handle sending the response back to the client.

### Summary
This function validates IDs, saves the content, sets an appropriate status code, and then passes control to the next middleware for response handling. If the IDs don’t match, it stops with a `400` error to ensure data consistency.

```js
const saveContent = (client) => async (content) => {
  const { body } = await client.index({
    index: CONTENT_INDEX_BASE_NAME,
    refresh: true,
    id: content.id,
    body: content
  })

  return {
    result: body.result
  }
}

The `saveContent` function is an asynchronous function that saves a content item to an index in a search client (likely Elasticsearch or OpenSearch). Here’s a breakdown of what each part does:

1. **Function Structure**:
   - `saveContent` is a higher-order function: it takes `client` as an argument and returns another asynchronous function that takes `content` as a parameter.
   - This approach makes it easier to reuse `saveContent` with different clients.

2. **Indexing Operation**:
   - Inside the inner function, `client.index` is called to add or update the content item in the specified index.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `index`: The index name where the content should be stored, which is referenced by `CONTENT_INDEX_BASE_NAME`.
     - `refresh: true`: Ensures that the index is refreshed immediately after this operation, making the new content available for search right away.
     - `id: content.id`: Specifies the `id` of the document, so if a document with the same `id` already exists, it will be updated. Otherwise, a new document will be created.
     - `body: content`: The content data itself is sent as the document body.

3. **Response Handling**:
   - The `client.index` operation returns a response object, from which `body.result` is extracted.
   - `result` indicates the outcome of the indexing operation:
     - Typically, `result` will be `"created"` if a new document was added or `"updated"` if an existing document was modified.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns an object containing the `result` of the indexing operation, allowing the calling function to determine if the content was newly created or updated.

### Summary
This function indexes a content item in a search engine and returns the result of the operation (`created` or `updated`). It ensures that changes are immediately searchable by setting `refresh: true`.

The `saveQuery` function is an Express middleware that saves a query item to a data source and sets the appropriate HTTP status based on whether the item was created or updated. Here’s a breakdown of what each part does:

1. **Destructure Request Properties**: 
   - The function extracts `params`, `body` (renamed as `query`), and `dataSources` from the `req` object.
     - `params`: Contains URL parameters, including `queryId`.
     - `body`: Holds the request body with the query data to be saved.
     - `dataSources`: Provides access to the `content` data source, which will handle the save operation.

2. **ID Validation**:
   - The function checks if the `queryId` in the URL matches the `id` field in the `query` object.
   - If they don’t match, it stops further processing and passes a `NotFoundError` to `next()`, which would result in a "404 Not Found" error response.

3. **Save Operation**:
   - If the IDs match, `dataSources.content.saveCurrentActive(req.body)` is called to save the query item.
   - This returns a `queryId` object, which includes a `result` field indicating the operation’s outcome (`updated` or `created`).

4. **Set HTTP Status Code**:
   - Based on the `result` field, the function maps `result` to a status code:
     - `updated` → `200 OK`
     - `created` → `201 Created`
   - `res.status(status[result])` sets the response status based on the operation result.

5. **Attach Response Data (Optional)**:
   - The commented-out lines suggest that `queryId` was intended to be merged into `req.responseData`, possibly for further processing by downstream middleware.

6. **Pass Control to the Next Middleware**:
   - Finally, `next()` is called to proceed to the next middleware, which will handle sending the response back to the client.

### Summary
The `saveQuery` function validates IDs, saves the query item, and sets the appropriate status code based on whether the item was created or updated. If the IDs don’t match, it sends a "404 Not Found" error to prevent processing a non-existent or mismatched record.

The `saveContent` function is an asynchronous function that uses a search client (likely Elasticsearch or OpenSearch) to index (save) a content item in a specific index. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Higher-Order Function**:
   - `saveContent` is a higher-order function. It takes a `client` as its first argument and returns another asynchronous function that takes `content` as an argument.
   - This pattern makes it easy to configure `saveContent` with different clients or configurations by providing `client` only once.

2. **Indexing Operation**:
   - Inside the inner function, the `client.index` method is called to index the content item into a specified index. This operation either adds the document if it’s new or updates it if a document with the same `id` already exists.
   - The `client.index` call includes several options:
     - **`index`**: Specifies the name of the index where the content will be stored, referenced by `CONTENT_INDEX_BASE_NAME`.
     - **`refresh: true`**: Ensures that the index is refreshed immediately after this operation, making the content available for search as soon as it's indexed.
     - **`id: content.id`**: Sets the document ID for this content item. If this ID already exists in the index, the existing document will be updated.
     - **`body: content`**: The content object itself is stored as the document body.

3. **Response Handling**:
   - The `client.index` method returns a response, from which `{ body }` is destructured.
   - `body.result` holds the result of the operation, typically indicating whether the document was `"created"` or `"updated"`.
   
4. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns an object containing `{ result: body.result }`, allowing the calling function to know if the content item was newly created or just updated.
```
### Summary
This function saves a content item to an index in a search client (e.g., Elasticsearch). It either creates a new document or updates an existing one based on `content.id`. The function immediately refreshes the index for search availability and returns an object indicating the result (`created` or `updated`). This approach ensures consistency in the index and allows efficient querying.

```js
const saveQuery = (client) => async (req, res, next) => { 
  const { queryId } = req.params

  try {
    await client.index({
       index: QUERY_INDEX_BASE_NAME,
       refresh: true,
       document: { queryId, timestamp: new Date() } 
    })

    await client.index({
      index: CURRENT_ACTIVE_BASE_NAME,
      document: { queryId, active: true, timestamp: new Date() }
    })

    req.responseData = {
      status: 'success',
      message: 'Query ID saved successfully'
    }

    next()
  }
  catch(error) {
    console.error('Error saving query ID: ', error)
    res.status(500).json({status: 'error', message: 'Failed to save Query ID'})
  }
}
```
The `saveQuery` function is an asynchronous Express middleware that saves a query ID to two different indices in a search client (e.g., Elasticsearch or OpenSearch) and responds based on the success or failure of the operation. Here’s a breakdown of each part:

1. **Higher-Order Function Structure**:
   - `saveQuery` is a higher-order function that takes `client` as an argument. This allows different clients to be passed in when `saveQuery` is used.
   - The inner function is asynchronous and takes `req`, `res`, and `next` as parameters, making it compatible with Express middleware.

2. **Extract Query ID**:
   - The function extracts `queryId` from the URL parameters (`req.params.queryId`).

3. **Indexing Operations**:
   - Two indexing operations are performed in sequence, each using `client.index`:
     - **First Operation**:
       - Adds an entry in the `QUERY_INDEX_BASE_NAME` index to log the query with the `queryId` and a `timestamp`.
       - **`index`:** Specifies the index name, `QUERY_INDEX_BASE_NAME`.
       - **`refresh: true`:** Ensures the index is refreshed immediately, making the new entry searchable.
       - **`document`:** Contains the document to store, including `queryId` and the current `timestamp`.
     - **Second Operation**:
       - Adds or updates an entry in the `CURRENT_ACTIVE_BASE_NAME` index to mark the query as active.
       - **`index`:** Specifies the `CURRENT_ACTIVE_BASE_NAME` index.
       - **`document`:** Contains `queryId`, a flag `active: true`, and the current `timestamp`.

4. **Setting Response Data**:
   - If both indexing operations succeed, the function sets `req.responseData` with a success message, indicating that the query ID was saved successfully. This data can be used by downstream middleware to generate the response.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - If an error occurs during either of the indexing operations, the `catch` block handles it.
   - **Logging**: Logs an error message to the console.
   - **Response**: Sends a `500 Internal Server Error` response with a JSON object containing `status: 'error'` and an appropriate message.

6. **Pass Control to Next Middleware**:
   - If no error occurs, `next()` is called to move to the next middleware in the chain, where `req.responseData` can be used to build the final response.

### Summary
The `saveQuery` function logs a query in two indices to track the query’s history and mark it as active. It handles successful operations by setting `req.responseData` with a success message and passes control to the next middleware. In case of an error, it logs the error and sends a `500` status response to the client. This function ensures both logging and error resilience when saving query data.

## Adjusted saveQuery

To adjust the `saveQuery` function to save a query template along with a unique ID, you can use a UUID to generate the unique identifier for each query. This way, each query template saved will have a distinct identifier that you can use to look it up later.

Here’s how to modify `saveQuery` to meet these requirements:

1. **Generate a Unique ID**: Use a UUID (or similar unique identifier) as the `queryId` instead of taking it from `req.params`. This unique ID can be stored in the index and later used to match or retrieve the specific query.

2. **Save Query Template with the Unique ID**: Save the query template with this unique ID in the appropriate index.

3. **Respond with the Unique ID**: Set `req.responseData` to include the unique ID so it can be accessed by the client.

Here’s how the revised `saveQuery` function could look:

```javascript
const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');  // Import a UUID generator

const saveQuery = (client) => async (req, res, next) => { 
  // Generate a unique ID for the query template
  const uniqueQueryId = uuidv4();
  
  try {
    // Save the query template with the generated unique ID in the first index
    await client.index({
       index: QUERY_INDEX_BASE_NAME,
       refresh: true,
       document: { 
         id: uniqueQueryId,          // Store the unique ID
         queryTemplate: req.body,     // Store the query template from the request body
         timestamp: new Date() 
       }
    });

    // Optionally save an "active" record for this query in another index
    await client.index({
      index: CURRENT_ACTIVE_BASE_NAME,
      refresh: true,
      document: { 
        queryId: uniqueQueryId,       // Reference the same unique ID
        active: true, 
        timestamp: new Date() 
      }
    });

    // Set response data to include the unique query ID
    req.responseData = {
      status: 'success',
      message: 'Query template saved successfully',
      queryId: uniqueQueryId          // Include the unique ID in the response
    };

    next();
  }
  catch(error) {
    console.error('Error saving query template: ', error);
    res.status(500).json({ status: 'error', message: 'Failed to save query template' });
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **`uuidv4()`**: This generates a unique ID (`uniqueQueryId`) for each query template, which can be saved and used for future lookups.

2. **Indexing with `uniqueQueryId`**:
   - The first `client.index` call saves the query template along with the `uniqueQueryId` in `QUERY_INDEX_BASE_NAME`.
   - The second `client.index` call saves a reference to this unique ID in `CURRENT_ACTIVE_BASE_NAME` and marks it as active.

3. **Response Data**:
   - `req.responseData` now includes `queryId: uniqueQueryId`, allowing downstream middleware to access this unique ID and send it in the response to the client.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - The `catch` block handles any errors during the indexing process, logging the error and sending a `500` error response.

### Summary
This updated `saveQuery` function generates a unique ID for each query template, saves the template in one index, optionally marks it as active in another, and includes the unique ID in the response. This setup allows you to use the unique ID to reference or retrieve the query template later.





Got it! To save a query template to both indexes with specific parameters for each, you can modify the function to create different document structures for each index. Here’s how you can implement it:

```javascript
const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');

// Function to save query template to both indexes
const saveQueryTemplateToBoth = (client) => async (req) => {
  // Generate a unique ID for the query
  const uniqueQueryId = uuidv4();

  // Define documents to be saved in each index
  const queryTemplateDocument = {
    id: uniqueQueryId,
    queryTemplate: req.body,
    timestamp: new Date(),
  };

  const currentActiveDocument = {
    queryId: uniqueQueryId,
    active: true,
    timestamp: new Date(),
  };

  // Save to QUERY_INDEX_BASE_NAME
  const queryIndexResult = await client.index({
    index: QUERY_INDEX_BASE_NAME,
    refresh: true,
    document: queryTemplateDocument,
  });

const activeResult = await client.index

  // Save to CURRENT_ACTIVE_BASE_NAME
  const activeIndexResult = await client.index({
    index: CURRENT_ACTIVE_BASE_NAME,
    document: currentActiveDocument,
  });

  // Return the unique ID and result statuses for both operations
  return {
    id: uniqueQueryId,
    results: [
      { index: QUERY_INDEX_BASE_NAME, result: queryIndexResult.body.result },
      { index: CURRENT_ACTIVE_BASE_NAME, result: activeIndexResult.body.result },
    ],
  };
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Generate Unique ID**: `uniqueQueryId` is created using `uuidv4()` and will be used to reference the same query across both indexes.
2. **Define Documents**:
   - `queryTemplateDocument`: This is the document for `QUERY_INDEX_BASE_NAME`, containing `id`, `queryTemplate` (from `req.body`), and a `timestamp`.
   - `currentActiveDocument`: This is for `CURRENT_ACTIVE_BASE_NAME`, containing `queryId`, `active: true`, and a `timestamp`.
3. **Indexing**:
   - The function uses `await client.index` twice to save each document to its respective index.
4. **Return Result**: Returns `uniqueQueryId` and the indexing results for each operation.

### Example Usage

To use this function, call it with your `client` and `req` object:

```javascript
const client = ...; // Elasticsearch client setup
const req = {
  body: { /* your query template here */ }
};

saveQueryTemplateToBoth(client)(req).then((response) => {
  console.log(`Template saved with ID: ${response.id}`);
  console.log('Results:', response.results);
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error('Error saving query template:', error);
});
```

This setup will save the query template to `QUERY_INDEX_BASE_NAME` and activate it in `CURRENT_ACTIVE_BASE_NAME` with a consistent ID. Let me know if you’d like further modifications!




## Example Query for POST API
{ "query": "{ function_score: { score_mode: sum, query: { bool: { must_not: { term: { type: season } }, filter: placeholder, should: { multi_match: { query: searchTerm, fields: [ title^15, tags^10, shortDescription, longDescription, people, people.bigrammed^10, airDateText, airDateText.bigrammed^4, rootParent.title^0.1, rootParent.shortDescription^0.1, rootParent.longDescription^0.1, rootParent.people^0.1, rootParent.people.bigrammed^0.1 ], tie_breaker: 0 } } } }, functions: [ { weight: 1000, filter: { term: { type: show } } }, { weight: 100, exp: { airDate: { origin: now, scale: 1825d, decay: 0.9 } } }, { weight: 1, filter: { match_phrase: { longDescription: { query: searchTerm, slop: 1, boost: 100 } } } }, { weight: 1, filter: { match_phrase: { title: { query: searchTerm, slop: 1, boost: 1000 } } } }, { weight: 1, filter: { match_phrase: { people: { query: searchTerm, slop: 1, boost: 1000 } } } }, { weight: 3, filter: { match_phrase: { titleFullMatch: { query: toFullMatch, boost: 1004 } } } }, { weight: 3, filter: { match_phrase: { peopleFullMatch: { query: toFullMatch, boost: 1000 } } } }, { weight: 1, filter: { match_phrase: { airDateText: { query: searchTerm, boost: 1000 } } } }, { weight: 1 } ] } }"
 }
